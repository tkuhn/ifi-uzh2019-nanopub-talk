Title: Semantic Publishing with Nanopublications

Abstract:
Computational techniques are becoming increasingly important in all branches of science, but the scientific findings that result from them cannot be readily interpreted by such computational techniques, because these findings are published in the form of narrative articles. These articles are designed for consumption by human readers but not for automated interpretation by software, preventing us from automatically link, aggregate, and reason with these scientific findings in a reliable fashion. Semantic publishing is an approach to deal with that problem by proposing to publish scientific findings directly in a computer-interpretable fashion. I will introduce in my talk the approach of nanopublications, which provide a structure for provenance-aware semantic publishing based on Linked Data. I will show results on how such nanopublications can be reliably identified and retrieved, how large datasets can be formed from independent data snippets, how natural and formal language can be combined to represent complex findings, and how this connects to the FAIR principles of scientific data publishing.

CV:
Tobias Kuhn is assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science of the VU University Amsterdam. He received his doctorate at the University of Zurich in 2010 for his thesis on controlled English for knowledge representation. After that, he was a lecturer and researcher at the University of Malta, postdoctoral associate at Yale University, a postdoc at ETH Zurich, and a visiting researcher at Stanford University, TU Dresden, and the University of Chile. His general research interests include knowledge representation, socio-technical systems, controlled natural languages, and scholarly communication. His recent work has focused on the nanopublication concept, provenance modeling, decentralized communication techniques, and the FAIR principles for data management.
